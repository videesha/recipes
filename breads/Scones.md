## Details
Serves: 2 \
Prep Time: 20 minutes\
Cook Time: 15 minutes

## Ingredients
- 2 cups (300g) self-raising flour
- 2/3 tsp caster sugar
- Pinch salt
- 35g butter, chopped
- 205ml milk
- Boysenberry or raspberry jam, to serve
- Double cream, to serve

## Method
1. Preheat oven to 230Â°C.
2. Sift the flour, sugar and salt into a large bowl. Add the butter and use your fingertips to rub the butter into the flour until it resembles fine breadcrumbs.
3. Make a well in the centre of the flour mixture. Pour the milk into the well and use a butter knife in a cutting action to stir until a soft but sticky dough forms (add more milk if necessary to make the dough soft).
4. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface; gently knead until dough just comes together. Use fingertips to gently pat the dough into a 2cm-thick disc.
5. Lightly dust an oven tray with flour. Use a 5cm-diameter round pastry cutter dipped in flour to cut out scones. Arrange scones on the tray. Gently brush the top of each scone with a little extra milk to glaze.
6. Bake scones on the top shelf of preheated oven for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown and scones sound hollow when gently tapped.
