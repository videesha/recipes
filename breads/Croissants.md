1. Add milk and knead until silky smooth (it will be sticky if doing by hand)
1. **Rise for 30min**
1. Deflate lightly and **Fridge for 2 hours**
1. Only when the dough is done in the fridge, bash the crap out of the butter until it's a square half an 12mm thick.
1. Roll out the dough as a rectangle of approx two butter squares of area
1. Fold the dough over the butter, seal it in.

1. Fold over itself twice, **fridge for TWO HOURS**
1. Allow dough to rest for 10mins outside the fridge, then roll out very thin, approx 35 by 60cm. This will take time, do not force it. It is important to keep the corners as square as possible
1. Fold dough in half, preserving the length of the longer side
1. Look up a youtube video for the rest of the croissant cutting and shaping
1. You have croissants on the baking tray, nice! Cover with plastic wrap, **rise for 2 hours**
