## Details
Serves: 6
Prep Time: 10 minutes
Cook Time: 10 minutes
Total: 20 minutes


## Ingredients
- 700 grams beef mince
- 1/2 cup onion grated
- 1/2 cup panko bread crumbs
- 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese grated
- 2 eggs
- 2 cloves garlic crushed
- 2 tablespoons milk
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt or to taste
- 1/2 teaspoon oregano
- 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 700ml jar passatta 

## Method
1. Combine all ingredients (except spaghetti sauce) until well mixed. Mixing together with your hands works great.
Form into balls using hands or small ice cream scoop. You want them to be slightly smaller than a golf ball.
2. Spray bottom of Instant Pot with cooking spray and add spaghetti sauce.
Place meatballs over the sauce, layering them if necessary. It's OK if they touch, just don't squish them too much.
3. Place lid on Instant Pot and switch valve to “sealing”. Press “Manual” and set to high pressure for 7 minutes.
4.After you hear the timer go off, allow to slow release for another 5 minutes and then do the quick release (you do this by carefully switching the tab to "venting").
Remove lid from Instant Pot, stir, and serve over cooked pasta noodles.
