## Details
Serves: 6\
Prep Time: 10 minutes\
Cook Time: 10 minutes\
Total: 20 minutes

## Ingredients
- 700 grams beef mince
- 1/2 cup onion grated
- 1/2 cup panko bread crumbs OR 1 slice sandwich bread
- 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese grated
- 2 eggs
- 2 cloves garlic crushed
- 2 tablespoons milk
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt or to taste
- 1/2 teaspoon oregano
- 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 700ml jar passatta 

## Method
1. If you don't have breadcrumbs, slice a piece of bread into 1 cm squares and soak in the grated onion while prepping other ingredients
2. Combine all ingredients (except spaghetti sauce) until well mixed. Mixing together with your hands works great.
Form into balls using hands or small ice cream scoop. You want them to be slightly smaller than a golf ball.
3. Spray bottom of Instant Pot with cooking spray and add spaghetti sauce.
Place meatballs over the sauce, layering them if necessary. It's OK if they touch, just don't squish them too much.
4. Pressure cook on High for 7 minutes 
5. Natural release for 5 minutes before quick releasing.
